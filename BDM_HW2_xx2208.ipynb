        "This homework explore [Safegraph data](https://www.safegraph.com/covid-19-data-consortium) to better understand how NYC response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will be looking at the [Places](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/core-places) data set and the [Weekly Pattern](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/weekly-patterns) data set to answer the following inquiry:\n",
        "\n",
        "> How many restaurants were closed from 03/17/20 (when the lock down started), and how many were closed from 04/01/20?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Notes\n",
        "\n",
        "* *NYC*: we only consider restaurants in NYC, which means those with the city listed as `'New York'`, `'Brooklyn'`, `'Queens'`, `'Bronx'`, or `'Staten Island'` (we will miss a lot of Queens restaurants where cities are listed in names other than `'Queens'`).\n",
        "\n",
        "* *Closed*: a restaurant is closed for the listed period if there were visits to the restaurants before 03/17/20 but none afterwards. Note that if the restaurant is closed for an entire week, there would be no report (instead of 7 zeros `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`) in the *Weekly Pattern* data set. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Requirements: \n",
        "You must use MRJob and MapReduce in a similar fashion as in Lab.\n",
        "\n",
        "### INPUT:\n",
        "To make it easier, we have already joined (and filtered) the two provided data sets into `nyc_restaurant_pattern.csv`, which has the visits pattern of all NYC restaurants. In other words, you only need to deal with a single input file `nyc_restaurant_pattern.cvs`, and would not need to fetch the original Safegraph data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### OUTPUT:\n",
        "Your MRJob only needs to output two rows as follows, each consists of a label (e.g. `\"The number ...\"`), and a count (e.g. `\"49\"`):\n",
        "```\n",
